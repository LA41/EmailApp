# EmailApp
In here my task was creating email accounts for new employees. This app does the following:

- generates email with <i>firstname.lastname@department.company.com</i> syntax;
- determines department (sales, development, acoounting, hr), if none leaves blank;
- generates a random string for a password;
- have set methods to change password, set mailbox capacity and define an alternate email address;
- have get methods to display name, email and mailbox capacity.
